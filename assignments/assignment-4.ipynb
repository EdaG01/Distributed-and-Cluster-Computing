    "### Assignment 4 (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, each team will extend and redesign the cluster created in Assignment 3 to include shared file systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part I: Nodes arrangement (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to modify the cluster's design from 4 nodes to  6 nodes. The nodes should be arranged in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 head node: has public floating IP address (accessible from outside) and fixed local IP address (subnet flat-lan-1-net)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3 compute nodes: has fixed local IP address (subnet flat-lan-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2 storage nodes: has fixed local IP address (subnet flat-lan-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "All nodes should have passwordless SSH access to one another\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Part II: Shared file system (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to set up two shared file systems, one networked file system (NFS), and one parallel file systems (OrangeFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The NFS is originated from the head node, and supports two shared directories: /home and /software. These two directories are to be mounted on the head node and compute nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The OrangeFS server is to be created on the 2 storage nodes, and forms the directory /scratch. This directory is to be mounted on the head node and compute nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "You should also think ahead at this stage and make sure the following information is included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automounting of shared directories\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inclusion of PATH on all compute nodes regarding software available through /software\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",

    "Resources:\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Part II: Set up HDP (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to set up HDP on your cluster. Unlike the previous assignments, the installation process can be done in real time following the instructions described in https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.6.1.5/bk_ambari-installation/content/ch_Getting_Ready.html\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "At minimum, you are to install the following services from Hortonworks HDP: HDFS, YARN, MapReduce, and Spark\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Part III: Update Oracle Linux VM (0 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reuse the baseline VM nodes from Assignment 2. As this assignment option does not require automatic deployment, you can make all the modifications according to the instructions in the installation guide of HDP. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Submission requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit a text file to Canvas containing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Names of members of your team\n",
    "\n",
    "- URL to your team's Github repository\n",
    "\n",
    "- Password for root and the student account\n",
    "\n",
    "- URL to your CloudLab experiment that has a successful deployment of the profile. The experiment's duration should have been extended such that there are at least 24 hours remain from the Canvas submission time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Any additional notes that I must be aware of when testing your experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each team should submit a text file to D2L containing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The URL to the team repository.\n",
    "- The URL to the experiment instance of Part 2 on CloudLab (should be instantiated the moment you submit the assignment on D2L)\n",
    "\n",
    "As there is a timer on CloudLab experiment, I will attempt to grade your assignment as soon as possible, and I will **assume** that I have between 12 to 16 hours (see Submission condition) to grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a team assignment. Each team should only have one submission"
